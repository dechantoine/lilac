And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same \"\"genocide state\"\" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia.

You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.\n\n3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden\n\n4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?\n\n5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your \"\"enemies.\"\" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is \"\"cynical.\"\" Those who don't believe in Dahn are \"\"cynical.\"\" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. \n\n6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.\n\n7.

If you'll check what I do around here, you'll see it is mainly to improve and defend the articles of scientists and other academics and related subjects.  But there are some difficulties. I can best exemplify the difficulty by saying that the article on John Tyler Bonner was nominated about 6 months ago for speedy deletion as \"\"did not assert notability\"\" and fortunately rescued. About one member of the US National academy of sciences gets nominated for deletion at AfD a month. They all get kept, but it takes work. \n\nWhat is needed for a successful article on a researcher is:\nA short bio listing the birth, degrees, positions. \nA paragraph describing the work and how it has been recognized as important\nA list of books, & a few major articles. When challenged, I add the number of citations for the most-cited. \nA list of awards and honors and editorships . \nI've been adding grants received. \nif possible a ref from a biographic noticethis gets much easier  after they have died. \nand of course none of it can be taken from a university or other web site, tho the site should be listed as supplying the details. \nPictures, as you've discovered, add problems. I usually dont try. \nThis works if: the person was a full professor at a recognized research university, and has an award or  two from outside the university. Otherwise there are problems; people at non-research places need very solid documentation. Professors of education need really solid documentation. \n \nFor educators not noted as researchersawards are needed for professional recognition, and at least one more than the president of NABT will in general be necessary.

Although its release preceded that of Let It Be, it was the last album to be recorded. \n...\nAfter the near-disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album (later retitled Let It Be for release), Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album \"\"just like the old days. .. just like we used to,\"\" free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album. Martin agreed to this if the band would be \"\"the way they used to be.\"\" In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and \"\"go out on a high note.\"\"re. the position of \"\"The End\"\":\"\"The End\"\" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by \"\"Her Majesty\"\".

For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the \"\"comparison\"\" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. \n\nTo be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.\n\nWe need to move the fanboi \"\"HD DVD is better\"\", \"\"No, Blu-ray is better!\"\", \"\"Well, HD DVD has more support!\"\", \"\"No, Blu-ray has more support!\"\" crap to the comparison articles.   18:13, 21\"",

After all, that is what Wikipedia is all about.''\n\nAnd the second is from Neelix's user page:\n\nWikipedia is thoroughly, inherently collaborative. In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.\n\nI think those principles are pretty neat. And I am certain my editing adheres to them.

Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts). Also there is no requirement for the Finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in Åland.

Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection.\"\" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.\n\nOn the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying \"\"I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.\"\"\n\nHowever, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.\n\nUnless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.\n\nBy the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it... \n\nAll the best,  | Talk \"",

This section was recently posted on the page, and reads unobjectively.

These bonds ended up funding corrupt activities and led to the county's bankruptcy.http://46in08.blogspot.com/2009/08/death-of-jefferson-county-alabama-and.html\n\nIn 2000, NASD regulators censured Raymond James & Associates, Inc. for “yield burning” activities on municipal securities. yield burning involves overcharges by brokerage firms on Treasury securities purchased with proceeds from the sale of municipal bonds. Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txt\n\nIn 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms. The minimal amount of due diligence conducted by the firm prevented them from discovering the fraud that was going on. The parent firm later went bankrupt causing millions in losses and one of the biggest fraud cases in the state of South Carolina.http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-02-05-homegold_x.htm\n\nIn 2003, Raymond James was found guilty of overcharging investors who made large purchases of mutual funds. There were nearly 160,000 trades that were overcharged and Raymond James had no systems in place to capture these trades.,http://www.txcm.com/reports/Raymond%20James%20mutual%20trading%20scandal.pdfhttp://registeredrep.com/institutions/raymondjames/finance_raymond_james_audits/\n\nIn 2005, the NASD fined Raymond James $750,000 for violations stemming from a failure to supervise the firm’s fee-based brokerage accounts.\n\nIn 2007, three ex-Raymond James employees sued, saying they were paid less than men and denied opportunities.http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/Women_claim_sex_bias_.shtml\n\nIn 2008, Jerry Rose was found to be conducting a ponzi scheme using Raymond James as custodian to the assets which amounted to over $16 million.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/story13.html\n\nIn 2008, Raymond James received lots of criticism for using obscure provisions under SOX in which they denied whistle-blowing claims on the basis that the claims were made against a subsidiary company.http://whistlersear.wordpress.com/tag/sox-whistleblower/ These laws were reversed when the new Frank Dowd act was put into place on July 21, 2010. Raymond James was mentioned as one of the companies that abused the laws, as a means to conduct ethical and legal grounds. This included the case of John Hughart v. Raymond James in which the complaints regarding lax supervision in compliance was overlooked on the grounds that the employee worked a a subsidiary and therefore had no opportunity for restitution from Raymond James.http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/SOX/2004/HUGHART_JOHN_v_RAYMOND_JAMES_and_AS_200",

Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.  Let the article writing (or rewriting) proceed based on these (or similar) books.  Once the article has been fleshed out, we can come back to the issue of Rao.  Otherwise, nothing will get done, and those of us, who've taken time out from our other Wikipedia (not to speak RL) pursuits to attend to the article, will slowly walk away, out of touch and out of sympathy.  «Talk» \"",

Per User:SteveLoughran's request, here it is.\n\nThe implementation details of S3 are not documented, but it is possible to infer aspects of it from the behaviour (and pricing) of the service.\n\n There is an S3 repository in the US; there is another in Europe. Their locations are not public.\n From an EC2 server, read access can initially be slow. This could imply that S3 data is not always in the same physical location as all the EC2 servers. \n Amazon do not bill for data transferred between the US EC2 server farm and the US S3 store, but they do for access between the servers and the European S3 store. While the S3 store and the EC2 servers may be in separate locations, they must be close enough together that cost of transferring data is neglible. Both services are presumably hosted on the same Metropolitan Area Ethernet.\n Connectivity between the S3 datastores and the rest of the Internet is good. This implies they  are close to one of the main Internet exchanges.\n After the initial slow access, later accesses are fast. This could imply that the data is cached.\n Write access is tangibly slower than writing to a local hard disk. Amazon guarantee that when the operation has completed, data has been written to disk in multiple locations. \n Amazon warn that even after data has been written, old values may still be read. This implies that there can be more than one cache of the data, and that every GET request does not trigger a check from the front-end caches to the back-end store.\n Amazon adjusted their initial pricing from a simple flat rate per GB to one that charges small frequently retrieved items per thousand GET or HEAD operations, rather than purely per byte. There may be a flat cost for every entry (indexing, billing entries) and a per-request cost in CPU-time for every access. These fixed overheads are now billed for.\n\nThe dynamic per-bucket DNS entries are implemented by having a custom S3 DNS server that returns a hostname for every host under the s3.amazonaws.com subdomain, even if a bucket of that name has never been created: \n> nslookup made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nmade-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com     canonical name = s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com.\ns3-directional-w.amazonaws.com  canonical name = s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.\nName:   s3-1-w.amazonaws.com\nAddress: 72.21.211.228\n\nAt the identified host, there is a web server that always serves up 404 error pages when a GET request against a nonexistent bucket is issued.\n\n> telnet made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com  80\nTrying 72.21.207.212...\nConnected to s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nGET / HTTP/1.0\nhost: made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com\n\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\nx-amz-request-id: F0F7301EF1873635\nx-amz-id-2: 9gT/YmUa7EZXIm9FNv7GGThAre8Kn5CEfXpoJpthwuq54Pm+5RRcThAdBa20XsLj\nContent-Type: application/xml\nDate: Wed, 27 Feb 2008 18:54:42 GMT\nConnection: close\nServer: AmazonS3\n\n\nNoSuchBucket\nThe specified bucket does not exist\nF0F7301EF1873635\nmade-up-name-for-wikipedia\n9gT/YmUa7EZXIm9FNv7GGThAre8Kn5CEfXpoJpthwuq54Pm+5RRcThAdBa20XsLj\n\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n\nNotice how the XML error text is intended for machine interpretation, rather than end users.

      "text": "\"Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.\n\nFirst, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)\nWhether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  \"\"No-boo\"\" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.\nIf the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called \"\"The No-boo Affair\"\", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is \"\"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did\"\", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a \"\"clear falsification\"\", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term \"\"no-boo\"\" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.\nWikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this \"\"No-boo Affair\"\" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.\n\nIt is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — 18:08, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)\"",

The page listed:\nAn open source bugtracker software\n\nThis text and the links contained are extremely confusing. The disambiguation template clearly states that if an internal link (such as the one from the comparison) leads to this disambiguation page, you should change that incoming link it to point to the appropriate article. Since the article did not exist and since the item in the list for the application was confusing, I decided to create a Scarab Bug Tracking page.\n\nTo make things as seamless as possible, I quickly copied the text from the old item into the new article, intending to improve the article as soon as it was created. Before I could make my modifications, you changed the content to link back to the list or something similarly stupid. (I would go back and read exactly what you changed it to, but you deleted the page, so I can’t check the history)\n\nAfter I reverted your changes and then made some minor changes to the content, I put the page up for move proposal to Scarab (software) to be more consistent with pages that are from disambiguation pages.\n\nThis morning I came back to the page to check if it had moved, but it was gone! I assumed that maybe it was just moved and that the old page no longer existed. I poked around the Move proposal list, and the disambiguation page that I had originally edited (Still in that state) and could no longer find the page.\n\nAs a person unfamiliar with all Wikipedia bullshit politics and confusing processes, it took me a while to figure out exactly what happened to the page I had created less than 24 hours ago. Finally I found it, the person who originally ruined my short article after less than ONE MINUTE of my edit, - you -, deleted it!\n\nIn your comments, you did not explain the reason for deletion, you only sited “A3”. To anyone but a Wikipedia user extremely familiar with deletion, this would be meaningless. An “article too short” would have been much better. After digging around a lot, I found that it was a reference to the third reason an _A_rticle could be deleted. Hence, the A3. You should AT LEAST link to that so people that aren’t familiar with Wikipedia jargon can figure out what that means without searching through piles and piles of horribly disorganized Wikipedia-politics-ridden pages.\n\nConsidering that the content I posted stated that it was a stub, the time it takes to delete an article, and the relative ‘freshness’ of the page, it makes you look like a deleting troll. If you thought that the page was clearly grounds for deletion, you should have put that inside the article or something and let it stand for a good 48 hours before finalizing the deletion.\n\nI agree that Wikipedia should not be laden with content-free articles, but having cyclic links from the disambiguation page, to the bug tracking software page, and back is worse. If there is no article to link to, there should be no link.\n\nThe only things that you achieved by deleting the page is: made yourself stand out as a stereotypical Wikipedia troll/nazi/zealot, put off a Wikipedia contributor from continuing to improve the quality of Wikipedia, wasted a lot of my time to investigate what the hell happened to the page I created, and broke at least two internal links.\n\nYou violated the spirit of Wikipedia and smashed what little hope I still had for the Wikipedia community.

I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally \"\"biased\"\" ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word \"\"intact\"\", which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this? After all, Jakew doesn't have a problem with the Wikipedia guidelines, because his personal bias is similar to the American/community bias on the topic of circumcision.  \"",

I am posting the section here in its entirety for reference.   \n\nLanguage and Mind-set of a Popular 1950s Musical\n\nSome parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now, though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of 1956: Crosby’s character sings a love song to an eleven-year-old girl (his ex-wife’s younger sister who still has quite a crush on him);  the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughter's body (while upbraiding her for having no compassion, as most characters in the movie have already or soon will);  and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex (separated from the movie-going masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of, or by necessity having to interact with the Newport upper class). When Tracy Lord (played by Kelly) awakens hungover on her wedding day, she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing, but comes to believe she “made love” with Mike the reporter (played by Sinatra) and discusses it at length with her ex-husband Dexter (played by Crosby). At the time, of course, \"\"making love\"\" was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. Being a romantic comedy, “High Society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.\n\nThere are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie, as Kittridge, the up-and-coming coal magnate (and fiance to the current mine owner’s daughter), is described as having worked his way up from being a miner, and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class, as is Sinatra's journalist character.\n\n\"",
